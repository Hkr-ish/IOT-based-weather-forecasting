# IoT-Based Temperature Forecasting System (Simulation-Driven Approach)

This project implements a simulation-driven IoT temperature forecasting system using Python and Flask. The system simulates temperature data from IoT sensors and uses machine learning to forecast future temperatures.

## Features
- Real-time temperature data simulation
- Machine learning-based temperature forecasting
- Interactive web dashboard with real-time visualization
- REST API for data access
- Historical data storage and retrieval

## Architecture
The system consists of several components:
1. Data Simulation Module - Generates realistic temperature data
2. Forecasting Engine - ML model for temperature prediction
3. Data Storage - Stores historical temperature data
4. REST API - Provides data access endpoints
5. Web Interface - Dashboard for visualization and control
6. Configuration Manager - Handles system settings

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- NumPy (Numerical Computing)
- Plotly/Chart.js (Data Visualization)
- SQLite (Data Storage)
